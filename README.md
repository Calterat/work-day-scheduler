<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](./assets/images/work-day-scheduler-screenshot.png)

Here's a quick screenshot of the word day scheduler page.

Under the hood of this webpage is my JavaScript code using Third-Party APIs like jQuery and Moment.js. This displays some of my abilities with JavaScript. You may enter your tasks at anytime slot, but don't forget to save! The save button just to the right of each task field will save only that task, so if you change another field without saving, don't expect another tasks save button to save those other tasks. The data persists in your localStorage, so if you leave and come back it will still be there.

This was a challenge as the third-party apps were new concepts, and the CSS was provided. Sometimes going through the existing code to figure out how you are suppose to use existing declarations is tough. I suppose I now understand the limitations of libraries and frameworks because you think about how you can shape your program according to what is provided rather than working from the ground up (which could take way too long depending on the size of the program) Challanges I faced on this project was the use of Java to dynamically create the HTML for display, how to assign saved tasks to localStorage, and how to retrieve them.

These are the learned tools in JavaSCript that I used to accomplish the this project:
 - Variables
 - Arrays
 - Objects
 - while and for loops
 - if/else conditional statements
 - functions
 - The DOM and other Web APIs
 - Third-Party APIs like jQeary and Moment.js
